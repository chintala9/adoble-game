# Adobe Game - Project Description

## What is Adobe Game?

Adobe Game is a fun, interactive word-guessing game inspired by the popular game Wordle, but with a special twist - it focuses on Adobe-related words! Think of it as a daily puzzle where you have to guess a 5-letter word related to Adobe products, services, or concepts.

## How Does It Work?

### The Basic Concept
Imagine you're playing a game where you need to guess a secret 5-letter word. You get 6 chances to figure it out, and after each guess, the game gives you helpful clues using colors:

- üü© **Green**: The letter is correct and in the right spot
- üü® **Yellow**: The letter is in the word but in the wrong position  
- ‚¨õ **Gray**: The letter is not in the word at all

### Example Game Play
Let's say the secret word is "PHOTO" and you guess "PAINT":

- P: üü® Yellow (P is in the word but not in the first position)
- A: ‚¨õ Gray (A is not in the word)
- I: ‚¨õ Gray (I is not in the word)
- N: ‚¨õ Gray (N is not in the word)
- T: üü® Yellow (T is in the word but not in the last position)

This helps you figure out that P and T are in the word somewhere, and you can use this information for your next guess!

## What Makes This Game Special?

### Adobe-Themed Words
Unlike regular word games, this one uses words related to Adobe's world:
- **ADOBE** - The company name
- **PHOTO** - Photography and Photoshop
- **LIGHT** - Lightroom
- **VIDEO** - Video editing
- **STOCK** - Stock photos and assets
- **COLOR** - Color theory and design
- **EMAIL** - Communication tools
- **FONTS** - Typography

### Smart Features
1. **Save Your Progress**: The game remembers where you left off, so you can come back later
2. **Share Your Game**: Send friends a link to see how you did
3. **Track Your Stats**: See which words you've solved and which ones you missed
4. **Keyboard Support**: Use your computer keyboard or the on-screen keyboard
5. **Mobile Friendly**: Works great on phones and tablets
